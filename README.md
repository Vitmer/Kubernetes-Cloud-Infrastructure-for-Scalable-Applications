# Kubernetes Cloud Infrastructure for Scalable Applications

## 📌 Project Goals:
  - Fully automated Kubernetes infrastructure deployment.
  - Production-ready CI/CD setup using ArgoCD + GitLab.
  - Auto-scaling microservices with integrated databases.
  - Security best practices and monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana).
  - Terraform + Helm for infrastructure management.

## 🔹 Project Architecture

### 1️⃣ Infrastructure

- **Terraform** – Deploys AKS cluster and infrastructure.
- **Kubernetes (AKS)** – Primary container orchestration platform.
- **Helm** – Simplifies manifest management.
- **ArgoCD** – CI/CD tool for automatic deployment.

### 2️⃣ Application

- **Microservice Application**:
  - FastAPI, Nginx, PostgreSQL, Redis.
- **Auto-scaling Services**:
  - HPA + VPA for optimal resource usage.

### 3️⃣ CI/CD

- **GitLab CI/CD** – Triggers for automatic deployment.
- **ArgoCD + Helm** – Declarative deployment.

### 4️⃣ Monitoring and Security

- **Prometheus + Grafana** – Metrics and alerts.
- **RBAC + IAM** – Security settings.
- **Network Policies** – Access control.

## 🔹 Full Project Plan

### 1️⃣ Infrastructure Development (Terraform + AKS + Helm)

#### 1.1 Deploying Kubernetes Cluster

  - ✅ Created AKS cluster using Terraform.
  - ✅ Configured Node Pools for Production and Development environments.
  - ✅ Configured Identity and IAM roles (Managed Identity, Service Principals).

#### 1.2 Configuring Helm for Manifest Management

  - ✅ Installed Helm in the cluster.
  - ✅ Created Helm charts for basic services.
  - ✅ Deployed ingress controller (NGINX) using Helm.

### 2️⃣ Microservice Application Setup

#### 2.1 API and Service Development

  - ✅ Developed FastAPI service.
  - ✅ Containerized the application with Docker.
  - ✅ Created Docker Compose for local testing.

#### 2.2 Database Integration

  - ✅ Deployed PostgreSQL in the cluster.
  - ✅ Configured Redis for caching.
  - ✅ Managed configurations through ConfigMaps and Secrets.

#### 2.3 Auto-scaling Services

  - ✅ Configured Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).
  - ✅ Configured Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA).
  - ✅ Configured resource allocations for optimal use.

### 3️⃣ CI/CD Setup with GitLab + ArgoCD

#### 3.1 Automating Deployment with GitLab CI/CD

  - ✅ Defined `.gitlab-ci.yml` for builds and tests.
  - ✅ Created Docker Registry in GitLab and pushed images.
  - ✅ Automatic deployment to the cluster via GitLab Runners.

#### 3.2 ArgoCD Setup

  - ✅ Installed ArgoCD in the cluster using Helm.
  - ✅ Configured GitOps approach (monitoring repository).
  - ✅ Automatic deployment through Kubernetes manifests.

### 4️⃣ Monitoring and Security

#### 4.1 Monitoring and Logging

  - ✅ Installed Prometheus and Grafana via Helm.
  - ✅ Configured metric collection from pods (Node Exporter, Kube State Metrics).
  - ✅ Set up alerts (Alertmanager).

#### 4.2 Security and Access Control

  - ✅ Configured RBAC and IAM roles.
  - ✅ Configured Network Policies.
  - ✅ Secured Secrets and ConfigMaps.

## 📌 Final Project Outcome

  - 🔹 Fully deployed Kubernetes infrastructure with CI/CD and monitoring.
  - 🔹 Auto-scaling microservice application with databases.
  - 🔹 Fully automated deployment via ArgoCD + GitLab.
  - 🔹 Secured environment with RBAC and Network Policies.
